# Boilerplate: Node.js and socket.io

### What is this?

This is a boilerplate to help you run node.js with socket.io. This is helpful if you are looking to create a web game or a real-time data application where dynamic values are updated on the page based on user actions. In this example, we are simply adding the number of visitors that are connected to the website simultaneously. If 3 visitors are bot on the website together, the website will show:

```
Number of visitors on the site: 3
```

If suddently one visitor closes their page, the text will accross all websites change for:

```
Number of visitors on the site: 2
```

You can start with this base and add pieces of code you already have. Or start writing adding your code on the repository cloned on your local via the terminal (see below). Don't forget to first **<u>fork</u>** the repository on your Github profile if you are using the platform.
